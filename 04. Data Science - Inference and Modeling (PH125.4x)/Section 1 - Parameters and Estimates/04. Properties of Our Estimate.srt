RAFAEL IRIZARRY: To understand how good our estimate is,

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,950
we'll describe the statistical properties of the random variable we

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,650
just defined, the sample proportion.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,350
Note that, if we multiply by N, N times X-bar is a sum of independent draws,

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,430
so the rules we covered in the probability module apply.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,230
Using what we have learned, the expected value of the sum N times X-bar

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,680
is N times the average of the urn, p.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,220
So, dividing by the nonrandom constant N gives us

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,440
that the expected value of the average X-bar is p.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,270
We can write it using our mathematical notation like this.

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,760
We also can use what we learned to figure out the standard error.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,170
We know that the standard error of the sum is square root of N

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,190
times the standard deviation of the values in the urn.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,440
Can we compute the standard error of the urn?

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,870
We learned a formula that tells us that it's

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,950
1 minus 0 times the square of p times 1 minus p,

17
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,970
which is the square root of p times 1 minus p.

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,370
Because we are dividing by the sum, N, we

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,240
arrive at the following formula for the standard error of the average.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,190
The standard error of the average is square root of p times 1 minus p

21
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,460
divided by the square root of N.

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,370
This result reveals the power of polls.

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,090
The expected value of the sample proportion, X-bar,

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,670
is the parameter of interest, p.

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,010
And we can make the standard error as small

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,570
as we want by increasing the sample size, N. The law of large numbers

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,640
tells us that, with a large enough poll, our estimate converges to p.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,260
If we take a large enough poll to make our standard error, say, about 0.01,

29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,020
we'll be quite certain about who will win.

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,210
But how large does a poll have to be for the standard error to be this small?

31
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,290
One problem is that we do not know p, so we can't actually

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,540
compute the standard error.

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,160
For illustrative purposes, let's assume that p is 0.51

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,200
and make a plot of the standard error versus the sample size N. Here it is.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,480
You can see that obviously it's dropping.

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,800
From the plot, we also see that we would need a poll of over 10,000 people

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,100
to get the standard error as low as we want it to be.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,490
We rarely see polls of this size due, in part, to costs.

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,800
We'll give other reasons later.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,890
From the RealClearPolitics table we saw earlier,

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:39,330
we learned that the sample sizes in opinion polls range from 500 to 3,500.

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,400
For a sample size of 1,000, if we set p to be 0.51,

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,270
the standard error is about 0.015, or 1.5 percentage points.

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,980
So even with large polls, for close elections,

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,270
X-bar can lead us astray if we don't realize it's a random variable.

46
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,270
But, we can actually say more about how close we can get to the parameter p.

47
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,930
We'll do that in the next video.

48
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,672
