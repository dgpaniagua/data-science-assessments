RAFAEL IRIZARRY: To help us understand the connection between polls

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,800
and the probability theory that we have learned, let's

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,160
construct a scenario that we can work through together

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,110
and that is similar to the one that pollsters face.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,940
We will use an urn instead of voters.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,620
And because pollsters are competing with other pollsters for media attention,

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,260
we will imitate that by having our competition with a $25 prize.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,950
The challenge is to guess the spread between the proportion

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,420
of blue and red balls in this urn.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,560
Before making a prediction, you can take a sample, with replacement,

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,030
from the urn.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,480
To mimic the fact that running polls is expensive,

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,450
it will cost you $0.10 per bead you sample.

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,960
So if your sample size is 250 and you win,

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,510
you'll break even, as you'll have to pay me $25 to collect your $25.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,050
Your entry into the competition can be an interval.

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,290
If the interval you submit contains the true proportion,

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,180
you get half what you paid and pass to the second phase of the competition.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,230
In the second phase of the competition, the entry with the smallest interval

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,140
is selected as the winner.

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,910
The dslabs package includes a function that shows a random draw from the urn

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,110
that we just saw.

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,150
Here's the code that you can write to see a sample.

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,580
And here is a sample with 25 beads.

25
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,500
OK, now that you know the rules, think about how

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,390
you would construct your interval.

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,990
How many beads would you sample, et cetera?

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,780
Notice that we have just described a simple sampling

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,820
model for opinion polls.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,190
The beads inside the urn represent the individuals

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,020
that will vote on election day.

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,080
Those that will vote Republican are represented with red beads

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,270
and the Democrats with blue beads.

34
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,090
For simplicity, assume there are no other colors,

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,430
that there are just two parties.

36
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,820
We want to predict the proportion of blue beads in the urn.

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,150
Let's call this quantity p, which in turn tells us

38
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:12,090
the proportion of red beads, 1 minus p, and the spread, p minus (1 minus p),

39
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,750
which simplifies to 2p minus 1.

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,160
In statistical textbooks, the beads in the urn are called the population.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,120
The proportion of blue beads in the population, p, is called a parameter.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,870
The 25 beads that we saw in an earlier plot after we sampled,

43
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,390
that's called a sample.

44
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,220
The task of statistical inference is to predict the parameter, p, using

45
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,110
the observed data in the sample.

46
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,780
Now, can we do this with just the 25 observations we showed you?

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,240
Well, they are certainly informative.

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,650
For example, given that we see 13 red and 12 blue,

49
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,422
it is unlikely that p is bigger than 0.9 or smaller than 0.1.

50
00:02:57,422 --> 00:03:03,810
Because if they were, it would be un-probable to see 13 red and 12 blue.

51
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,960
But are we ready to predict with certainty that there

52
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,480
are more red beads than blue?

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,310
OK, what we want to do is construct an estimate of p

54
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,640
using only the information we observe.

55
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,480
An estimate can be thought of as a summary of the observed data

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,270
that we think is informative about the parameter of interest.

57
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,820
It seems intuitive to think that the proportion of blue beads in the sample,

58
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,610
which in this case is 0.48, must be at least related to the actual proportion

59
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,660
p.

60
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,572
But do we simply predict p to be 0.48?

61
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:46,590
First, note that the sample proportion is a random variable.

62
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,410
If we run the command take_poll(25), say four times,

63
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,870
we get four different answers.

64
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,700
Each time the sample is different and the sample proportion is different.

65
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,100
The sample proportion is a random variable.

66
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,730
Note that in the four random samples we show,

67
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,920
the sample proportion ranges from 0.44 to 0.6.

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,250
By describing the distribution of this random variable,

69
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,480
we'll be able to gain insights into how good this estimate is

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,230
and how we can make it better.

71
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,299
