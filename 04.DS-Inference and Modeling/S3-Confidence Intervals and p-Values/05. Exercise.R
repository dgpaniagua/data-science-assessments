# Add a statement to this line of code that will add a new column named `d_hat` to `polls`. The new column should contain the difference in the proportion of voters.
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% filter(enddate >= "2016-10-31" & state == "U.S.") 


# Assign the sample size of the first poll in `polls` to a variable called `N`. Print this value to the console.


# Assign the difference `d_hat` of the first poll in `polls` to a variable called `d_hat`. Print this value to the console.


# Assign proportion of votes for Clinton to the variable `X_hat`.


# Calculate the standard error of the spread and save it to a variable called `se_hat`. Print this value to the console.



# Use `qnorm` to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of voters. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.

##ANSWER

# Add a statement to this line of code that will add a new column named `d_hat` to `polls`. The new column should contain the difference in the proportion of voters.
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% filter(enddate >= "2016-10-31" & state == "U.S.") %>% mutate(d_hat=rawpoll_clinton/100 - rawpoll_trump/100)

# Assign the sample size of the first poll in `polls` to a variable called `N`. Print this value to the console.
N <- polls$samplesize[1]

# Assign the difference `d_hat` of the first poll in `polls` to a variable called `d_hat`. Print this value to the console.
d_hat <- polls$d_hat[1]

# Assign proportion of votes for Clinton to the variable `X_hat`.
X_hat <- (d_hat + 1)/2

# Calculate the standard error of the spread and save it to a variable called `se_hat`. Print this value to the console.
se_hat <- 2*sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/N)
se_hat

# Use `qnorm` to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of voters. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.
ci <- c(d_hat - qnorm(0.975)*se_hat, d_hat + qnorm(0.975)*se_hat)
