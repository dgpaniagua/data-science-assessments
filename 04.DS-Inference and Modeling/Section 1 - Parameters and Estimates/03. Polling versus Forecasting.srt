RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Before we continue, let&#39;s

1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,140
make an important clarification related to the practical problem of forecasting

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,460
the election.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,850
If a poll is conducted 4 months before the election,

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,410
it is estimating the p for that moment, not for election day.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,150
But, note that the p for election night might

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,070
be different since people&#39;s opinions fluctuate through time.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,240
The polls provided the night before the election tend to be the most accurate

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,480
since opinions don&#39;t change that much in a couple of days.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,020
However, forecasters try to build tools that model how opinions

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,260
vary across time and try to predict the election day

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,060
result, taking into consideration the fact that opinions fluctuate.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,150
We&#39;ll describe some approaches for doing this in a later section.
