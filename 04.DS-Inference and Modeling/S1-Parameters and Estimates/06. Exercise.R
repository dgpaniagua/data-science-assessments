##EXERCISE:

# The vector `p` contains 100 proportions of Democrats ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

# The vector `sample_sizes` contains the three sample sizes
sample_sizes <- c(25, 100, 1000)

# Write a for-loop that calculates the standard error `se` for every value of `p` for each of 
# the three samples sizes `N` in the vector `sample_sizes`. Plot the three graphs, using the 
# `ylim` argument to standardize the y-axis across all three plots.


##ANSWER

for (i in sample_sizes) {
  se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/i)
  plot(p, se, ylim=c(0, 0.1))
}
