##EXERCISE:

# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# Create a variable `p` that contains 100 proportions ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function


# Create a variable `se` that contains the standard error of each sample average


# Plot `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis


##ANSWER

# Create a variable `p` that contains 100 proportions ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(0, 1, length.out=100)

# Create a variable `se` that contains the standard error of each sample average
se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)

# Plot `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis
plot(p, se)
