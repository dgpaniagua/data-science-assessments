######### EXERCISE: #########

#---------------
# From Exercise 6:
# Load the libraries and data you need for the following exercises
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data("polls_us_election_2016")

# These lines of code filter for the polls we want and calculate the spreads
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% 
  filter(pollster %in% c("Rasmussen Reports/Pulse Opinion Research","The Times-Picayune/Lucid") &
           enddate >= "2016-10-15" &
           state == "U.S.") %>% 
  mutate(spread = rawpoll_clinton/100 - rawpoll_trump/100) 
#--------------

# The `polls` data have already been loaded for you. Use the `head` function to examine them.
head(polls)

# Create an object called `sigma` that contains a column for `pollster` and a column for `s`, the standard deviation of the spread

# Print the contents of sigma to the console

######### ANSWER #########

# Create an object called `sigma` that contains a column for `pollster` and a column for `s`, the standard deviation of the spread
sigma <- polls %>% group_by(pollster) %>% summarize(s=sd(spread))

# Print the contents of sigma to the console
sigma
