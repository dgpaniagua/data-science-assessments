######### EXERCISE: #########

----------------------
# From Exercise 1:
# Load the 'dslabs' package and data contained in 'heights'
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
# Make a vector of heights from all males in the population
x <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>%
  .$height
---------------------
  
# The vector of all male heights in our population `x` has already been loaded for you. You can examine the first six elements using `head`.
head(x)

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# Define `N` as the number of people measured
N <- 50

# Define `X` as a random sample from our population `x`
X <- sample(x, N, replace = TRUE)

# Define `se` as the standard error of the estimate. Print this value to the console.

# Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population average based on our sample. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.

######### ANSWER #########

# Define `se` as the standard error of the estimate. Print this value to the console.
se = sd(X)/sqrt(N)
se

# Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population average based on our sample. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.
ci <- c(mean(X) - qnorm(0.975)*se, mean(X) + qnorm(0.975)*se)
