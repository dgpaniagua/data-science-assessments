######### EXERCISE: #########

# Define `Pr_1` as the probability of the first son dying of SIDS
Pr_1 <- 1/8500

# Define `Pr_2` as the probability of the second son dying of SIDS
Pr_2 <- 1/100

# Define `Pr_B` as the probability of both sons dying of SIDS
Pr_B <- Pr_1*Pr_2

# Define Pr_A as the rate of mothers that are murderers
Pr_A <- 1/1000000

# Define Pr_BA as the probability that two children die without evidence of harm, given that their mother is a murderer
Pr_BA <- 0.50

# Define Pr_AB as the probability that a mother is a murderer, given that her two children died with no evidence of physical harm. Print this value to the console.

######### ANSWER #########

Pr_AB <- (Pr_BA*Pr_A)/Pr_B
Pr_AB
