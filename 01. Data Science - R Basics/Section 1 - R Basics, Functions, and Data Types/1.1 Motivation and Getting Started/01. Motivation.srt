RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In this series, we'll be using the R software

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,550
environment for all our analyses.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,330
Throughout our data science series, you will learn R and data analysis

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,310
techniques simultaneously.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,290
Your R skills will improve throughout the series.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,270
So in this course, rather than cover every R skill you need,

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,360
we provide the building blocks so you can grow your knowledge as you

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,189
go through the series.

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,220
We find that we better retain our knowledge when we

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,620
learn it to solve a specific problem.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,080
As in throughout the series, in this course,

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,230
we'll use a motivating case study.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,900
In this case, it's related to crime in the United States.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,650
A relevant data set and some basic R skills

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,680
will permit us to answer specific questions related to the topic.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,840
Imagine you live in Europe, and you're offered a job in a US company

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,750
with many locations across all states.

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,120
It is a great job, but news with headlines such as "US Gun Homicide Rate

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,980
Higher Than Other Developed Countries" have you worried.

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,400
Charts like this one, where we can see the US having a much higher homicide

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,750
rate than other rich countries, worries you.

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,880
You're about to decline the job, but then you

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,350
wonder if perhaps these news reports are a bit sensationalist.

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,530
You note, for example, that other European countries,

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,000
such as the Lithuania, Ukraine, and Russia, are not in this chart,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,680
and they have higher rates than the US, higher than 4 per 100,000.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,390
You're also reminded that the US is a large and diverse country with 50

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,260
very different states and the District of Columbia.

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,700
California, for example, has a larger population than Canada.

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,650
20 US states have populations larger than that of Norway.

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,720
In some respects, the variability across states in the US

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,630
may be akin to the variability across countries in Europe.

35
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,280
So back to your job.

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
You have options of where to live, and want

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,800
to find out how safe each state is.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,580
We will do this using R. We will examine data

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,520
related to gun homicides in the US.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,930
However, in the first few videos, we go over some logistics

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,610
and introduce general concepts that are the building blocks of what comes next.

42
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,320
It will not be immediately obvious how all these concepts are useful,

43
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,450
but later in the course, and later in this series, it will become clear.

44
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,950
After we're done with the basics, we'll have our first real data science

45
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,820
experience.

46
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,710
We will delve into the homicide data, and answer practical, real world

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,560
questions.

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,187
