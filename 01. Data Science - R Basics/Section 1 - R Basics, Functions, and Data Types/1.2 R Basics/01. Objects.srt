RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Before we get started with a motivating data set,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,240
we need to cover the very basics of R. I'm going to start with objects.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,400
And I'm going to use a very simple example here.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,790
Suppose a high school student asks us for help

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,180
solving several quadratic equations of the form a x-squared

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,750
plus b x plus c equals 0.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,430
We know the quadratic equation gives us a solution, shown here.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,710
One advantage of programming language is that we can define variables and keep

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,780
such expressions general.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,300
So, if we are asked to solve x squared plus x minus 1 equals 0,

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,820
and we're going to use the quadratic equation,

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,270
we can define a to be 1, b to be 1, and c to be minus 1.

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,050
In R, we do that using the assignment symbol, which

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,990
is a less than followed by a minus.

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,760
Note that it looks like a little arrow.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,720
You're assigning 1 to a, you're assigning 1 to b,

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,070
you're assigning minus 1 to c.

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,910
Note that we can also use the equals sign for assignment,

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,990
but we recommend against it, because using it can cause confusion.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,290
Try this out in your console.

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,400
Try to define a, b, and c in your console.

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,080
Note that R does not print anything out when you make these assignments.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,010
This is good.

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,330
Had you made a mistake, you would have received an error message.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,185
To see the value stored in a variable we simply type it like this.

28
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:39,210
We type a in the console.

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,280
And when we hit Return, R shows us the value stored in a, which is 1.

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,080
A more explicit way to ask R to show us the value that's saved in a variable

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,830
is to use a print function like this.

32
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,300
So we write print parentheses, and inside the parentheses,

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,950
the object name a.

34
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,890
We use the term object to describe stuff that

35
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,110
is stored in R. Variables are examples, but objects can also

36
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,580
be more complicated entities such as functions, which are described later.

37
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,910
As we define objects in the console, we are actually

38
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,090
changing what is called the workspace.

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,800
You can see all the variables saved in your workspace by typing ls().

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,460
This is a function that shows you the names of the objects saved

41
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,730
in your workspace.

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,780
If you type it here, you will see as an answer, a, b, and c,

43
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,150
the three objects we have defined.

44
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,600
IDEs usually have a tab that if you click on it,

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,530
it actually shows you all these variable names.

46
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,280
Now, if you try to recover the value of a variable that

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,890
is not in your workspace, you'll receive an error.

48
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,480
For example, if you type x, which we haven't defined,

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,110
you will receive an error message that says, "Error: object 'x' not found."

50
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,770
Now, since these values are saved in variables,

51
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,550
to obtain a solution to our equation, we use the quadratic formula.

52
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,250
We type it out in R. We do that, we get 0.61 for the first solution,

53
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,050
and negative 1.61 for the second one.

54
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,614
