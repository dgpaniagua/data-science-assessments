RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Histogram and density plots

1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,900
provide excellent summaries of a distribution.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,600
But can we summarize even further?

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,420
We often see the average and the standard deviation

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,940
used as a summary statistic for a list of numbers, a two number summary.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,230
To understand what these summaries are and why they are so widely used,

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,600
we need to understand the normal distribution.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,080
The normal distribution, also known as the bell curve

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,130
and as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most famous

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,980
mathematical concepts in history.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,580
A reason for this is that approximately normal distributions

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,190
occur in many situations.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,290
Examples include, gambling winnings, heights, weights, blood pressure,

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,470
standardized test scores, and experimental measurement error.

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,560
There are explanations for this, but we explain it later.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,200
Here we focus on how the normal distribution helps us summarize data.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,019
Rather than using data, the normal distribution

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,960
is defined with a mathematical formula.

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,700
Let&#39;s see what this is.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,460
For any interval, a and b, the proportion of values in the interval

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,580
can be computed using this formula.

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,850
You don&#39;t need to memorize or understand the details of the formula.

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,580
We&#39;re going to have R code that computes it for us.

23
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,790
But note that it is completely defined by just 2 parameters, m and s.

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,400
The rest of the symbols in the formula represent the interval ends, a and b,

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,710
and known mathematical constants, pi and e.

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,360
These two parameters, m and s, are referred to as the average, also

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,090
call the mean, that&#39;s why we use the letter m,

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,560
and the standard deviation of the distribution respectively.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,580
The distribution is symmetric, centered at the average,

30
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,740
and most values, about 95%, are within two standard deviations

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,450
from the average.

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,930
Here&#39;s what the distribution looks like when the average is zero

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,919
and the standard deviation is one.

34
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,970
The fact that the distribution is defined by just two parameters

35
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,740
implies that if a dataset is approximated by a normal distribution,

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,040
all information needed to describe this distribution

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,690
can be encoded in just two numbers, the average and the standard deviation,

38
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,880
which we now define for an arbitrary list of numbers.

39
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,640
For a list of numbers contained in a vector that we&#39;ll call x,

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,770
the average is simply defined as a sum of x divided by the length of x.

41
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,090
Here&#39;s the code that you use in R. And the standard deviation

42
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,810
is defined with the following formula.

43
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,050
It&#39;s the square root of the sum of the differences between the values

44
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,050
and the mean squared divided by the length.

45
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,260
You can think of this as the average distance

46
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,350
between the values and their average.

47
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,110
Let&#39;s compute the average and the standard deviation

48
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,080
for the male heights, which we will store in an object

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,150
called x using this code.

50
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,740
The pre-built function, mean and SD can be used here.

51
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,620
We don&#39;t have to type out the code that we showed before,

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,090
because these functions are so common that pre-built functions exist.

53
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,580
So the code would actually look like this.

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,920
We see that the average height is 69.31 inches

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,180
and the standard deviation is 3.61 inches.

56
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,080
So here is a plot of the smooth density of our male heights.

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,120
We&#39;re making no assumptions here, other than assuming it&#39;s somewhat smooth.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,730
And then overlaid with a black curve is the normal distribution

59
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,910
that has average 69.31, and standard deviation 3.61.

60
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,220
Note how close those two are.

61
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,870
This is telling us that the normal distribution approximate

62
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,750
the distribution of our male heights.

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,370
Before we continue, let&#39;s introduce the concept of standard units.

64
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,290
For data that is approximately normal, it

65
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,560
is convenient to think in terms of standard units.

66
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,720
The standard unit of value tells us how many standard deviations away

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,150
from the average this value is.

68
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,110
Specifically for a value x, we define the standard unit

69
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,390
as z equals x minus the average divided by the standard deviation.

70
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,590
If you look back at the formula for the normal distribution,

71
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,930
you notice that what is being exponentiated is negative z squared.

72
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,790
The maximum of e to the minus z squared over 2

73
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,610
is when z equals 0, which explains why the maximum of the distribution

74
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,470
is at the average.

75
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,640
It also explains the symmetry, since negative z squared

76
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,430
is symmetric around 0.

77
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,830
To understand why standard units are useful,

78
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,090
notice that if we convert normally distributed data into standard units,

79
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,970
we can quickly know if for example, a person is about average height, that

80
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,520
would mean z equals 0.

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,340
A person that is tall would be z equals 2.

82
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,890
A person that is short would be z equals negative 2.

83
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,460
And extremely rare occurrences, say a 7 footer or something like that,

84
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,410
would have a z bigger than 3.

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,700
Or someone very short would have a z smaller negative 3.

86
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,600
Note that it does not matter what the original units are.

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,420
These rules apply to any data that is approximately normal.

88
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,270
In R, we can quickly obtain standard units using the function scale.

89
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,460
Type in this code.

90
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,560
Now back to our example.

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,290
To see how many men are within two standard deviations from the average,

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,940
now that we were already converted to standard units, all we have to do

93
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,150
is count the number of z&#39;s that are less than 2 and bigger than negative 2,

94
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,690
and then divide by the total.

95
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,190
So we take the mean of this quantity that you see here in the code,

96
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,170
and we see that the proportion is 0.951.

97
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,720
Note that it&#39;s about 95%, which is exactly

98
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,790
what the normal distribution predicts.

99
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,100
So it&#39;s quite useful.

100
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,040
If we can assume that the data is approximately normal,

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,730
at least for this interval, we can predict the proportion

102
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,160
without actually looking at the data.

103
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,520
We simply know that 95% of the data for normally

104
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,460
distributed data is between negative 2 and 2.

105
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,550
Now to further confirm that in fact the approximation is a good one,

106
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,740
we need to look at other intervals.

107
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,560
And for this, we will use quantile plots.
