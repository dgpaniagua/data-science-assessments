RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Smooth density plots are similar to histograms,

1
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,530
but are aesthetically more appealing.

2
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,930
Here&#39;s what a smooth density plot looks like for our male heights data.

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,400
We&#39;re going to learn how to make these plots and what they mean.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,680
Note that we no longer have sharp edges at the interval boundaries

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,050
and that many of the local peaks have been removed.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,210
Also notice that the scale of the y-axis changed from counts to something

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,060
new called density.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,340
To understand the smooth densities, we have

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,760
to understand estimates, a topic we don&#39;t cover until later.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,720
However, we provide a heuristic explanation

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,240
to help you understand the basics, and so you

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,460
can use this useful data visualization tool and learn how to interpret it.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,860
The main new concept you have to understand

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,480
is that we assume that our list of observed values of observed heights

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,840
comes from a much, much larger list of unobserved values.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,620
So in the case of male heights, you can imagine

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,420
our lists of students heights comes from a hypothetical list containing

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,920
all the heights of all the male students in all the world measured

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,700
very precisely.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,620
So as an example, let&#39;s suppose that we have a million of these.

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,600
This list of values, like any other list of values, has a distribution.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,330
And this is really what we want to report

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,345
to ET, since it is much more general.

24
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:34,190
Unfortunately, we don&#39;t get to see it.

25
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,420
However, we can make an assumption that helps us perhaps approximate.

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,920
Because we&#39;re assuming that we have a million values measured very precisely,

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,120
we can make a histogram with very, very small bins.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,870
This is going to help us understand what smooth densities are.

29
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,549
The assumption is that if we do this, consecutive bins will be similar.

30
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,840
This is what we mean by smooth.

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,560
We don&#39;t have big jumps from bin to bin.

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,220
Here&#39;s a hypothetical histogram with a bin size of 1

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,820
from the hypothetical list of 1 million values.

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,820
And here&#39;s what happens when we make the bins smaller and smaller.

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,560
You can see that the edges start disappearing and the histogram

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,970
becomes smoother.

37
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,600
For this hypothetical situation, the smooth density

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,590
is basically the curve that goes through the top of the histogram bars

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,970
when the bins are very, very small.

40
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,230
You can see it in the plot as a blue curve.

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,530
To make the curve not depend on the hypothetical size

42
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,450
of the hypothetical list, we compute the curve on the frequency scale

43
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,550
rather than the count scale.

44
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,050
OK.

45
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,390
Now back to reality.

46
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,690
With our example, we don&#39;t have millions of measurements.

47
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,740
Instead, we have 708 and we can&#39;t make a histogram with very, very small bins.

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,870
So how can we estimate this hypothetical smooth curve

49
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,239
that we would see if we would see all the measurements?

50
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,280
So what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to start

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,250
by making a histogram with our data, compute frequencies rather than counts,

52
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,920
and using the bin size appropriate for our data,

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,850
so the histogram looks like this.

54
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,670
Because it is a small sample, we get unsmooth variation in these heights.

55
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,710
To smooth the histogram what we&#39;re going to do

56
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,480
is we&#39;re going to start by keeping the heights of the histogram bar shown here

57
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,310
with little points.

58
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,970
We keep these points.

59
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,530
And now we draw a smooth curve that goes through the top

60
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,120
of these histograms bars.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,660
That&#39;s the blue curve.

62
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,890
And we get what we call the smooth density.

63
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,890
Here&#39;s what the final product looks like.

64
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,760
Before we continue, note that smooth is a relative term.

65
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,120
We can actually control the smoothness of the curve that

66
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,820
defines a smooth density through an option in the function, the GG plot

67
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,600
option that computes the smooth density.

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Here are two example using different degrees

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,690
of smoothness on the same histogram.

70
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,760
On the left, we see a curve this more jagged.

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,459
It goes up and down quickly.

72
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,839
And on the right, we see a curve that goes up and then goes down smoothly.

73
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,890
We need to make this choice with care, as the resulting visualization

74
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,810
can change our interpretation of the data.

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,050
We should select a degree of smoothness that we

76
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,520
can defend as being representative of the underlying data.

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,830
In the case of height, we really do have reason

78
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,260
to believe that there are a proportion of people

79
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,960
with similar heights should be about the same.

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,370
For example, the proportion that is 72 inches

81
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,090
should be more similar to the proportion of the 71 inches

82
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,510
than the proportion that is 78 or 65.

83
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,870
This implies that the curve should be pretty smooth, more

84
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,020
like the example on the right than the example on the left.

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,020
Always keep in mind that while the histogram is an assumption

86
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,400
free summary, the smooth density is based on assumptions and choices

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,890
that you make as a data analyst.

88
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,230
Finally, to be able to interpret density plots,

89
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,130
we need to understand the units of the y-axis.

90
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,730
We point out that interpreting the y-axis of a smooth density plot

91
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,710
is not straightforward.

92
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,820
It is scaled so that the area under the density curve adds up to 1.

93
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,300
So if you imagine, you form a bin with a base that is 1 unit long.

94
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,620
The y-axis value tells us the proportion of values in that bin.

95
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,910
But this is only true if the bin is of size 1.

96
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,710
For other size intervals, the best way to determine the proportion of data

97
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,690
in that interval is by computing the proportion of the total area contained

98
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,290
in that interval.

99
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:59,910
Here&#39;s an example, if we take the proportion of values between 65 and 68,

100
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,380
it&#39;ll equal the proportion of the graph that is in that blue region

101
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,420
that we&#39;re showing you right there.

102
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:12,270
The proportion of this area is about 0.31, meaning that about 31%

103
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,540
of our values are between 65 and 68 inches.

104
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,950
Now that we understand this, we are ready to use a smooth density

105
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,270
as a summary.

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,910
For this dataset, we would feel quite comfortable

107
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,040
with the smoothness assumption.

108
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,430
And therefore, we&#39;re sharing the aesthetically pleasing figure

109
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,650
with ET, which you could use to understand our male height data.

110
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,180
As a final note, we point out that an advantage

111
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,490
of smooth densities over histograms is that it makes it easier

112
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,470
to compare two distributions.

113
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,350
This is in large part because the jagged edges of the histogram add clutter,

114
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,810
so when we&#39;re comparing two histograms, it makes it a little bit hard to see.

115
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,220
Here&#39;s an example of what it looks like when you use density plots.

116
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,870
With the right argument, GG plot automatically

117
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,980
shades the intersecting regions with different colors.

118
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,370
So it makes it very easy to get an idea of what the two distributions are.
