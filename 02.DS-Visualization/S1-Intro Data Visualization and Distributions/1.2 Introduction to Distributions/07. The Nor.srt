RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In the data visualization module,

1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,940
we introduced the normal distribution as a useful approximation

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,260
to many naturally occurring distributions,

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,590
including that of height.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,470
The cumulative distribution for the normal distribution

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,250
is defined by a mathematical formula, which in R can

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,460
be obtained with the function pnorm.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,430
We say that a random quantity is normally distributed with average, avg,

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,720
and standard deviation, s, if its probability distribution

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,390
is defined by f of a equals pnorm a, average, s.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,130
This is the code.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,120
This is useful, because if we are willing to use the normal approximation

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,480
for say, height, we don&#39;t need the entire dataset

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,410
to answer questions such as, what is the probability that a randomly selected

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,680
student is taller than 70.5 inches.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,650
We just need the average height and the standard deviation.

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:06,900
Then we can use this piece of code, 1 minus pnorm 70.5 mean of x, sd of x.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,680
And that gives us the answer of 0.37.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,710
The normal distribution is derived mathematically.

19
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,130
Apart from computing the average and the standard deviation,

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,920
we don&#39;t use data to define it.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
Also the normal distribution is defined for continuous variables.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,720
It is not described for discrete variables.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,180
However, for practicing data scientists, pretty much everything we do

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,340
involves data, which is technically speaking discrete.

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,180
For example, we could consider our adult data categorical

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,840
with each specific height a unique category.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,760
The probability distribution would then be

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,610
defined by the proportion of students reporting each of those unique heights.

29
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,260
Here is what a plot of that would look like.

30
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,880
This would be the distribution function for those categories.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,180
So each reported height gets a probability

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,660
defined by the proportion of students reporting it.

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,280
Now while most students rounded up their height to the nearest inch,

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,160
others reported values with much more precision.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:23,239
For example, student reported his height to be 69.6850393700787.

36
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:24,030
What is that about?

37
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,490
What&#39;s that very, very precise number?

38
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,380
Well, it turns out, that&#39;s 177 centimeters.

39
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,270
So the student converted it to inches, and copied and pasted the result

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,940
into the place where they had to report their heights.

41
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,310
The probability assigned to this height is about 0.001.

42
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,720
It&#39;s 1 in 708.

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,740
However, the probability for 70 inches is 0.12.

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,870
This is much higher than what was reported with this other value.

45
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,920
But does it really make sense to think that the probability of being exactly 70

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,460
inches is so much higher than the probability of being 69.68?

47
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,300
Clearly, it is much more useful for data analytic purposes

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,720
to treat this outcome as a continuous numeric variable.

49
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,920
But keeping in mind that very few people, perhaps none,

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,930
are exactly 70 inches.

51
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,950
But rather, that people rounded to the nearest inch.

52
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,400
With continuous distributions, the probability of a singular value

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,450
is not even defined.

54
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,230
For example, it does not make sense to ask

55
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,730
what is the probability that a normally distributed value is 70.

56
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,610
Instead, we define probabilities for intervals.

57
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,570
So we could ask instead, what is a probability that someone

58
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,800
is between 69.99 and 70.01.

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,070
In cases like height in which the data is rounded,

60
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,830
the normal approximation is particularly useful

61
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,090
if we deal with intervals that include exactly one round number.

62
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,020
So for example, the normal distribution is

63
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,630
useful for approximating the proportion of students

64
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,310
reporting between 69.5 and 70.5.

65
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,360
Here are three other examples.

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,630
Look at the numbers that are being reported.

67
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,589
This is using the data, the actual data, not the approximation.

68
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,330
Now look at what we get when we use the approximation.

69
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,220
We get almost the same values.

70
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,200
For these particular intervals, the normal approximation is quite useful.

71
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,960
However, the approximation is not that useful for other intervals.

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,020
For example, those that don&#39;t include an integer.

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,370
Here are two examples.

74
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,450
If we use these two intervals, again, this

75
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,330
is the data, look at the approximations now with the normal distribution.

76
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,650
They&#39;re not that good.

77
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,850
In general, we call this situation discretization.

78
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,060
Although the true height distribution is continuous,

79
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,060
the reported heights tend to be more common at discrete values,

80
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,290
in this case, due to rounding.

81
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,410
As long as we are aware of how to deal with this reality,

82
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,440
the normal approximation can still be a very useful tool.
