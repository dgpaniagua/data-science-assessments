RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Here we introduce a new motivating problem.

1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,130
It is an artificial one, but it&#39;ll help us illustrate the concepts needed

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,800
to understand distributions.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,680
Later, we&#39;ll move on to more realistic examples.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,530
Pretend that we have to describe the heights of our classmates

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:27,100
to ET, an extraterrestrial that has never seen humans.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,310
As a first step, we need to collect data.

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,270
To do this, we asked students to report their heights in inches.

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,640
We asked them to provide sex information because we

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,390
know there are two different groups of heights, males and females.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,090
We collect the data and save it in a data frame.

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,170
We&#39;ve done that already, and here are the first six entries.

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,110
One way to convey the heights to ET is to simply

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,950
send him the list of 924 heights.

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,850
But there are much more effective ways to convey this information,

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,750
and understanding the concepts of distributions will help.

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,140
To simplify the explanation at first, we focus on male heights.

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,040
The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,050
is its distribution.

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,840
The simplest way to think of a distribution

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,220
is as a compact description of a list with many elements.

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,010
This concept should not be new for most of us.

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,220
For example, with categorical data, the distribution

23
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,640
simply describes the proportions of each unique category.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,500
For example, the sex represented in the heights data set

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,030
can be summarized by the proportions of each of the two categories,

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,710
female and male.

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,610
This two category frequency table is the simplest form

28
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,250
of a distribution we can form.

29
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,740
Now, we don&#39;t really need to visualize it

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,850
since one number describes everything we need to know about this data set.

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,370
23% are females and the rest are males.

32
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,010
That&#39;s all we need to know.

33
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,370
When there are more categories, then a simple bar plot

34
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,110
describes the distribution.

35
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,190
Here&#39;s an example showing the proportions of state regions

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,480
for the 50 states, plus DC, that we looked at earlier.

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,880
We can see in the plot with the height of the bar

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,780
tells us the proportion of the four regions

39
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,250
Northeast, South, North Central, and West.

40
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,780
Although this particular plot, a graphical representation of a frequency

41
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,420
table, does not provide much more insights than the table itself,

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,850
it is a first example of how we convert a vector

43
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,300
into a visualization that succinctly summarizes

44
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,850
all the information in that vector.

45
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,200
When the data is numerical, the task is much more challenging.

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,100
Why is it more complicated?

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,330
Well, in general, when data is not categorical,

48
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,180
reporting the frequency of each unique entry

49
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,330
is not an effective summary since most entries are unique.

50
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,420
For example, while several students reported a height of 68 inches,

51
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:12,910
only one student reported a height of 68.503937007874 inches.

52
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:20,800
And only one student reported a height of 68.8976377952756 inches.

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,980
We assume that they converted from 174 centimeters and 175 centimeters

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,990
to inches respectively.

55
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,500
Statistics textbooks teach us that a more useful way

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,170
to define a distribution for numerical data

57
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,500
is to define a function that reports the proportion of the data

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,450
below a value A for all possible values of A.

59
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,550
This function is called a cumulative distribution function or CDF.

60
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,510
In statistical textbooks, the following mathematical notation is used.

61
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,720
We define a function f of a and make that equal to the proportion of values

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,310
x less than or equal to a, which is represented with this Pr, meaning

63
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,490
proportion or probability, and then in parentheses

64
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,580
the event that we require, x less than a.

65
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,350
Here&#39;s a plot of the function f for the height data.

66
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,200
Like the frequency table does for categorical data,

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,769
the CDF defines the distribution for numerical data.

68
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:27,940
From the plot we can see, for example, that 14% of the students in our class

69
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,460
have heights below 66 inches.

70
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,550
How do we know this?

71
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,850
Because if we look at the value of f at 66, it&#39;s .138.

72
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,900
We also see that 84% of our students have heights below 72 inches.

73
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,890
This is because if we look at the value of f at 72, it&#39;s 0.839.

74
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,480
In fact, we can report the proportion of values between any two heights,

75
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,600
say a and b, by computing f of b, and then subtracting f of a.

76
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,930
This means that if we send this plot to ET,

77
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,750
he will have all the information needed to construct the entire list.

78
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,860
Final note, because CDFs can be determined mathematically,

79
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,580
as opposed to using data as we do here, the word empirical

80
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,920
is added to distinguish, and we use the term empirical CDF or ECDF.

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Although the CDF provides all the information we need and it is widely

82
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,080
discussed in statistics textbooks, the plot

83
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,150
is actually not very popular in practice.

84
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,570
The main reason is that it does not easily

85
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,000
convey characteristics of interest, such as,

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,090
at what value is the distribution centered,

87
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,070
is the distribution symmetric, what range contains 95% of the data.

88
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,780
We can decipher all this from the plot, but it&#39;s not that easy.

89
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,620
Histograms are much preferred because they greatly

90
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,490
facilitate answering such questions.

91
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,590
Histograms sacrifice just a bit of information

92
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,430
to produce plots that are much easier to interpret.

93
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,930
The simplest way to make a histogram is to divide a span of our data

94
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,890
into non-overlapping bins of the same size.

95
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,970
Then for each bin, we count the number of values that fall in that interval.

96
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:23,240
The histogram plots these counts as bars with the base of the bar the interval.

97
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,250
Here&#39;s a histogram for the height data where we split the range of values

98
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,330
into one inch intervals.

99
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,780
So we start with the interval 53.5 to 54.5,

100
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,540
then divide the rest into one inch intervals,

101
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,330
all the way up to 80.5 to 81.5.

102
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,270
If we send this plot to ET, he will immediately

103
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,810
learn some important properties about our data.

104
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,500
First, the range of data is from 55 to 81,

105
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,890
but perhaps more importantly, he learns that the majority, with more than 95%,

106
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,230
are between 63 and 75 inches.

107
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,570
Second, the heights are close to symmetric around 69 inches.

108
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,840
Also note, that by adding up counts, ET could

109
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,610
obtain very good approximations of the proportion of the data in any interval.

110
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,520
So it provides almost all the information

111
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,300
that we provided with the CDF.

112
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,080
We provide almost all the information contained

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:30,460
in the raw data that is 708 heights, with just 23 bin counts.

114
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,680
So why is it an approximation?

115
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,870
What information do we lose?

116
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,410
Note that all values in each interval are treated as the same

117
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,730
when computing the bin heights.

118
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,730
So for example, the histogram does not distinguish

119
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,930
between 64, 64.1, and 64.2 inches.

120
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,040
Given that these differences are almost unnoticeable to the eye,

121
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,120
in this particular case, the practical implications are negligible.
