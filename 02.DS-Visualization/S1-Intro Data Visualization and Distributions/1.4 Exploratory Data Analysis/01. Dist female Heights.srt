RAFAEL IRIZARRY: We started this series of videos

1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,550
by asking to describe heights of students to ET.

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,240
However, we&#39;ve only described male heights.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,090
We did this with just two numbers.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,910
So to give a full summary of heights, we still have to summarize female heights.

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,830
We expect that they will follow a normal distribution, just like the men.

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,240
However, exploratory plots reveal that the approximation is not as useful.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,520
We can see it in the density plot or the q-q plot.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,330
We see something that we did not see for males.

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,850
The density plot has a second bump around 67.

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,890
Looks like a little shoulder.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,130
Also the q-q plot shows that the highest points tend to be taller than expected

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,510
for the normal distribution.

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,990
So when reporting back to ET, we might need

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,950
to provide a histogram rather than just the average and the standard deviation

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,630
for the female heights.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,280
More importantly, we have noticed something that we didn&#39;t expect to see.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,750
This reminds us of a quote from Tukey, &quot;The greatest value of a picture

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,550
is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.&quot;

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,310
If we look at other female height distributions from other sources,

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,850
other than our self-reported heights, we do

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,700
find that they are well approximated for the normal distribution.

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,000
So why do we see a second hump in our data?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,880
Why do we see so many outliers, so many taller than expected women?

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,060
Is our class a requirement for the female basketball team?

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,610
Are small proportions of females claiming to be taller than they are?

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,010
Another, perhaps more likely explanation,

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,410
is that in the form students used to enter their heights,

28
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,330
the internet form, female was the default sex,

29
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,510
and some males may have entered their heights,

30
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,450
but they forgot to change the sex variable.

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,250
In this case, in our data set, some of the values that are supposedly

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,980
from females are actually males.

33
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,979
In any case, this is a good example of how

34
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,790
data visualization has helped us discover a potential flaw in our data.
