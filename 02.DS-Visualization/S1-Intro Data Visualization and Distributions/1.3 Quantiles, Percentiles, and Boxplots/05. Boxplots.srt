RAFAEL IRIZARRY: To introduce box plots, we will go back to the US murders data.

1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,260
Suppose we want to summarize the murder rate distribution.

2
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,230
Using the data visualization techniques we have learned,

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,010
we notice that the normal approximation does not apply here.

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,520
We can see it in the histogram, we can see it in the QQ plot.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,690
In this case, the histogram or smooth density plot,

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,320
would serve as a relatively succinct summary.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,860
Now suppose you were trying to describe this data to someone

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,070
who is used to receiving just two numbers, the average

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,570
and the standard deviation.

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,390
In this case, that&#39;s not an appropriate summary,

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,310
but they still want something compact.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,520
Here, John Tukey offers some advice.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,980
Provide a five number summary composed of the range along with the quartiles,

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,160
25th, 50th, and 75th percentile.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,210
Tukey further suggests that we ignore outliers when computing the range,

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,750
and instead plot these as independent points.

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,690
We provide a detailed explanation of outliers later.

18
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,560
Finally, he suggests that we plot this five number summary

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,220
as a box with whiskers like this.

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,900
The box is defined by the 25th and 75th percentiles,

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,860
and the whiskers are showing the range.

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,090
The distance between these two percentiles

23
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,880
is called the interquartile range.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,360
The two points that are outliers according to Tukey&#39;s definition,

25
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,400
those are shown separately, and the median is shown with a horizontal line.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,600
Today, we call these boxplots.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,250
From just a simple plot, we know that the median is about 2.5,

28
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,640
that the distribution is not symmetric, and that the range

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,440
is 0 to 5 for the great majority of states with two exceptions, the two

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,690
outliers.

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,590
Boxplots are even more useful when we want to quickly compare

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,840
two or more distributions.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,680
For example, here are the heights for men and women

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,389
from our self-reported heights from previous videos.

35
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:16,070
The plot immediately reveals that men are on average taller than women.

36
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,110
We also see that the standard deviation appears to be similar.
