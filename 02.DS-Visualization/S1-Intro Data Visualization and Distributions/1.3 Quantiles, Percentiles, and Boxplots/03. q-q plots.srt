RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In a previous video, we described

1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,330
how, if a distribution is well approximated

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,270
by the normal distribution, we can have a very useful and short summary.

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,620
But to check if, in fact, it is a good approximation,

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,730
we can use quantile-quantile plots, or q-q plots.

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,980
We start by defining a series of proportion, for example, p equals 0.05,

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,940
0.10, 0.15, up to 0.95.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,130
Once this is defined for each p, we determine the value q,

8
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,780
so that the proportion of the values in the data below q is p.

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,192
The q&#39;s are referred to as the quantiles.

10
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:52,800
To give a quick example, for the male heights

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,250
data that we showed in previous videos, we have that 50% of the data

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,370
is below 69.5 inches.

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:11,700
So this means that if p equals 0.5, then the q associated with that p is 69.5.

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,690
Now, we can make this computation for a series of p&#39;s.

15
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,010
If the quantiles for the data match the quantiles for the normal distribution,

16
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:27,570
then it must be because the data is approximated by a normal distribution.

17
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,650
To obtain the quantiles for the data, we can use the quantile function

18
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,520
in r like this.

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,780
So we&#39;re going to define an object called observe quantiles, and calculate

20
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,680
the quantiles for x at the series of values of p,

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,440
which is stored in the object p.

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,470
To obtain the theoretical normal distribution quantiles

23
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,320
with the corresponding average and standard deviation,

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,270
we use the qnorm function, like this.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,990
We&#39;re going to find an object called theoretical quantiles.

26
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,710
To see if they match or not, we can plot them against each other,

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,710
and then draw an identity line to see if the points fall on the line.

28
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,370
We can do this using the plot function, like this.

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,150
Very simple piece of code produces this plot.

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,100
Note that the points fall almost on the line,

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,530
meaning that the normal approximation is a pretty good approximation.

32
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,050
Now, one final note.

33
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,350
This code becomes slightly simpler if we use standard units.

34
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,860
If we use standard units, we don&#39;t have to define

35
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,430
the mean and the standard deviation in the function qnorm.

36
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,250
So the code simplifies and looks like this.

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,050
Now, using the histogram, the density plots, and the q-q plots,

38
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,610
we have become convinced that the male height data is well approximated

39
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,630
with a normal distribution.

40
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:52,020
So in this case, we can report back to ET a very succinct summary.

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,830
Male heights follow a normal distribution,

42
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:01,880
with an average of 69.44 inches, and a standard deviation of 3.27 inches.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,240
With this information, ET will have everything

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,380
he needs to know to describe, and know what to expect,

45
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,160
when he meets our male students.
