RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In this short video, we define some terms that are commonly

1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,540
used in exploratory data analysis.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,610
Percentiles are special cases of quantiles that are commonly used.

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,350
The percentiles are the quantiles you obtain

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:26,690
when you define p as 0.01, 0.02, up to 0.99, 1%, 2%, 3%, et cetera.

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,480
This is why we call them percentiles.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,310
We call, for example, the case of p equals 0.25 the 25th percentiles.

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,950
This gives us the number for which 25% other data is below.

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,010
The most famous percentile is the 50th, also known as the median.

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,770
Note that for the normal distribution, the median and the average

10
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,550
are the same.

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,220
But this is not generally the case.

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,270
Another special case that receives a name are the quartiles,

13
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:03,070
which are obtained when we set p to be 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75.
