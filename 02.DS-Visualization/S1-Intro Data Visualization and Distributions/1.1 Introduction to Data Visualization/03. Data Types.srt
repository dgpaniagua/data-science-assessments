RAFAEL IRIZARRY: An important first step in deciding how to visualize data

1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,640
is to know what type of data it is.

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,360
We will be working with two types of variables-- categoricals

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,980
and numericals.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,640
Each can be divided into two further groups.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,190
Categoricals can be divided into ordinals and non-ordinals.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:30,450
And numerical variables can be divided into discrete or continuous.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,600
Variables that are defined by a small number of groups

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
we call categorical data.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,290
Two simple examples are sex, male or female, or regions of the states

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,620
that we looked at in the first course--

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,020
Northeast, South, Central, West.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,090
Some categorical data can be ordered.

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,690
For example, spiciness can be mild, medium, or hot.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,860
Even if they are not numbers per se, they can still be ordered.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,870
In statistics textbooks they sometimes refer to these as ordinal data.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,270
The other data type are numericals.

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,070
Examples that we have seen or will see are population sizes, murder rates,

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,660
and heights.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,890
We can further divide numerical data into continuous and discrete.

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,700
Continuous variables are those that can take any value such as heights

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,990
if measured with enough precision.

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:27,160
For example, a pair of twins maybe 68.12 inches and 68.11 inches respectively.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,420
Counts such as population sizes are discrete

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,140
because they have to be round numbers.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,060
Note that discrete numeric data can be considered ordinal.

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,540
An example are heights rounded to the nearest inch.

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,730
Although this is technically true, we usually

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,640
reserve the term &quot;ordinal data&quot; for variables

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,370
belonging to a small number of different groups

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,530
with each group having many members.

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,310
In contrast, when we have many groups with few cases in each group,

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,610
we typically refer to this as discrete numerical variables.

33
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,340
So for example, the number of packs of cigarettes a person smokes a day

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,699
rounded to the closest pack-- so 0, 1, or 2--

35
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,039
would be considered ordinal.

36
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,800
While the number of cigarettes that we smoke--

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,650
0, 1, 2, 3 up to maybe 36--

38
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,230
would be considered a numerical variable.

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,070
But indeed, these examples can be considered both

40
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,200
when it comes to data visualization.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,000
Now that we&#39;ve learned about the different data types,

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,600
we&#39;re ready to learn about data visualization techniques.
