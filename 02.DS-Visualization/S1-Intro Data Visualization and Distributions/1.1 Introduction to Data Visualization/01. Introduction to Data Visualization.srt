RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Looking at the numbers and character strings

1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,400
at the final dataset is rarely useful.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,390
To convince yourself, print and stare at the US murders data table.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,920
You can do this with this code.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,410
What do you learn from staring at this table?

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,370
How quickly can you determine which states have the largest populations?

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,380
Which states have the smallest?

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,720
How large is a typical state?

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,740
Is there a relationship between population size and total murders?

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,220
How do the murder rates vary across regions of the country?

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,980
For most human brains, it is quite difficult

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,690
to extract this information just from looking at the numbers.

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,250
In contrast, the answer to all of these questions

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,660
are readily available from examining this plot.

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,490
We are reminded of the saying, &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,460
Data visualization provides a powerful way

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,490
to communicate a data driven finding.

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:07,280
In some cases, the visualization is so convincing that no follow up analysis

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,690
is required.

19
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,370
The growing availability of informative data sets and software tools

20
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,270
has lead to increased reliance on data visualization

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,620
across many industries, academia, and government.

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,280
A visible example are news organizations that are increasingly

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,530
embracing data journalism and including effective info-graphics

24
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,740
and charts as part of their reporting.

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,360
A particularly effective example is a Wall Street Journal article

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,630
showing data related to the impact of vaccines

27
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,330
on battling infectious diseases.

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,320
One of the graphs shows measles cases by US state

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,860
through the years with a vertical line demonstrating

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,230
when the vaccine was introduced.

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,560
Another striking example comes from the New York Times.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,060
This article showed data on scores from the New York City regents exam.

33
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,790
These scores are collected for several reasons,

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,460
including to determine if a student graduates from high school.

35
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,340
In New York City, you need a 65 to pass.

36
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,340
The distribution of the test scores forces

37
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,080
us to notice something somewhat problematic.

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,460
The most common test score is the minimum passing grade.

39
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,850
With very few just below that value.

40
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,480
This unexpected result is consistent with students

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,620
close to passing having their scores bumped up.

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,520
This is an example of how data visualization can

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,040
lead to discoveries which would otherwise

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,050
be missed if we simply subject that data to a battery of data analysis, tools,

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,660
or procedures.

46
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,150
Data visualization is the strongest tool of what

47
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,390
we call exploratory data analysis.

48
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,200
John Tukey, considered the father of exploratory data analysis

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,440
once said, the greatest value of a picture

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,970
is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.

51
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,610
We note that many widely used data analysis

52
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,590
tools were initiated by discoveries made with exploratory data analysis.

53
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,040
Exploratory data analysis is perhaps the most important part of data analysis,

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,850
yet it is often overlooked.

55
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,280
Data visualization is also now pervasive and philanthropic

56
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,950
in educational organizations.

57
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,860
One example comes from GAPminder and the talks, New Insights on Poverty

58
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,520
and the Best Stats You&#39;ve Ever Seen, Hans Roslings

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,450
forced us to notice the unexpected with a series of plots

60
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,420
related to world health and economics.

61
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,150
In his videos, he used animated graphs to show us how the world was changing,

62
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,750
and how old narratives are no longer true.

63
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,430
It is also important to note that mistakes, biases, systematic errors,

64
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,060
and other unexpected problems often lead to data

65
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,250
that should be handled with care.

66
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,420
Failure to discover these problems often leads to flawed analyses

67
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,100
and false discoveries.

68
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,680
As an example, consider that measurement devices sometimes fail

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,910
and that most data analysis procedures are not designed to detect these yet.

70
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,790
These data analysis procedures will still give you an answer.

71
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,400
The fact that it can be hard or impossible to notice an error just

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,020
from the reported results makes data visualization particularly important.

73
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,640
In this course, we will learn the basics of data visualization

74
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,250
and exploratory data analysis.

75
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,280
We will use motivating examples.

76
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,580
We will use the ggplot2 package to code.

77
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,290
To learn the basics, we will start with a somewhat artificial example, heights

78
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,660
reported by students.

79
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,290
Then we will cover two of the examples we mentioned,

80
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,460
world health and economics, and infectious diseases

81
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,580
trends in the United States.

82
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,790
Note that there&#39;s much more to data visualization that

83
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,960
will be covered here.

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,060
But you will get a very good introduction to the topic.
