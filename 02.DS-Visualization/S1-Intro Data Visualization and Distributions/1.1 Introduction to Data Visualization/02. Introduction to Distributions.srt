[KEYBOARD TYPING]

1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,380
RAFAEL IRIZARRY: You may have noticed that numerical data is often

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,090
summarized with an average value.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,080
For example, the quality of a high school is sometimes

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,770
summarized with one number--

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,730
the average score in a standardized test.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,770
Occasionally, a second number is reported

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,000
as well-- the standard deviation.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,910
So, for example, you might read a report stating that scores at this high school

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,200
were 680 plus or minus 50.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,870
The last number is the standard deviation.

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,380
Note that the report has summarized an entire vector of scores

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,240
with just two numbers.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,530
Is this appropriate?

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,570
Is there any important piece of information

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,370
we&#39;re missing by only looking at this summary rather than the entire list?

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,610
It turns out that in some cases, these two numbers

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,850
are pretty much all we need to understand the data.

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,270
Data visualization techniques will help us determine when

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,180
this two-number summary is appropriate.

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,209
These same techniques will serve as alternatives for when

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,150
these two numbers are not enough.

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,420
Our first data visualization building block

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,350
is learning to summarize lists of factors or numeric vectors.

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,210
The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,100
is its distribution.

26
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,520
Once a vector has been summarized as a distribution,

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,030
there are several data visualization techniques to effectively relay

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,360
this information.
