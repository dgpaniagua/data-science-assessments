## STATEMENT:

yan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

# Assign the variable 'p_yellow' as the probability that a yellow ball is drawn from the box.

# Using the variable 'p_yellow', calculate the probability of drawing a yellow ball on the sixth draw. Print this value to the console.

## ANSWER:

# Assign the variable 'p_yellow' as the probability that a yellow ball is drawn from the box.
p_yellow <- yellow / (cyan + magenta + yellow)

# Using the variable 'p_yellow', calculate the probability of drawing a yellow ball on the sixth draw. Print this value to the console.
