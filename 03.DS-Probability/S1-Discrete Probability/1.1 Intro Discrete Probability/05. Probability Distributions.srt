RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Defining a distribution for categorical outcomes

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,810
is relatively straight forward.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,290
We simply assign a probability to each category.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,160
In cases that can be thought of as beads in an urn, for each bead type,

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,490
the proportion defines the distribution.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,070
Another example comes from polling.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,610
If you're are randomly calling likely voters from a population that

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:34,810
has 44% Democrat, 44% Republican, 10% undecided, and 2% green,

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,730
these proportions define the probability for each group.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,220
For this example, the probability distribution

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,890
is simply these four proportions.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,670
Again, categorical data makes it easy to define probability distributions.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,200
However, later in applications that are more common in data science,

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,550
we will learn about probability distributions for continuous variables.

15
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,220
In this case, it'll get a little bit more complex.

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,280
But for now, we're going to stick to discrete probabilities

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,480
before we move on.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,419
