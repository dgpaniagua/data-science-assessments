00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,580
RAFAEL IRIZARRY: We start by covering some basic principles related to categorical data.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,200
This subset of probability is referred to as discrete probability.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,750
It will help us understand the probability theory

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,460
we will later introduce for numeric and continuous data, which is more

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,970
common in data science applications.

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,280
Discrete probability is more useful in card games

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,110
and we use these as examples.

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,110
The word probability is used in everyday language.

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,400
For example, Google's auto complete of, what are the chances of,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,360
gives us getting pregnant, having twins, and rain tomorrow.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,540
Answering questions about probability is often hard, if not impossible.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,260
Here, we discuss a mathematical definition of probability

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,380
that does permit us to give precise answers to certain questions.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,560
For example, if I have two red beads and three blue beads inside an urn

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,030
and I pick one at random, what is the probability of picking a red one?

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,990
Our intuition tells us that the answer is 2/5, or 40%.

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,720
A precise definition can be given by noting

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,350
that there are five possible outcomes of which two satisfy

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,150
the condition necessary for the event "pick a red bead."

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,930
Because each of the five outcomes has the same chance of occurring,

21
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,810
we conclude that the probability is 0.4 for red and 0.6 for blue.

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,080
A more tangible way to think about the probability of an event

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,750
is as a proportion of times the event occurs

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,490
when we repeat the experiment over and over independently and under the same

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,980
conditions.

26
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,860
Before we continue, let's introduce some notation.

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,820
We use the notation probability of A to denote the probability of an event A

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,230
happening.

29
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,320
We use the very general term event to refer

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,840
to things that can happen when something happens by chance.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,540
For example, in our previous example, the event was picking a red bead.

32
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,810
In a political poll, in which we call 100 likely voters

33
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,260
at random, an example of an event is calling

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,120
48 Democrats and 52 Republicans.

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,570
In data science applications, we will often deal with continuous variables.

36
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,970
In these cases, events will often be things like,

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,520
is this person taller than 6 feet?

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,550
In this case, we write events in a more mathematical form.

39
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,430
For example, x greater than 6.

40
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,590
We'll see more of these examples later.

41
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,710
Here, we focus on categorical data and discrete probability.

42
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,051
