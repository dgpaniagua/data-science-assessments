RAFAEL IRIZARRY: We say that two events are independent if the outcome of one

1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,920
does not affect the other.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,180
The classic example are coin tosses.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,240
Every time we toss a fair coin, the probability of seeing heads

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,860
is 1/2 regardless of what previous tosses have revealed.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,710
The same is true when we pick beads from an urn with replacement.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,860
In the example we saw earlier, the probability of red

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,780
was .40 regardless of previous draws.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,860
Many examples of events that are not independent come from card games.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,530
When we deal the first card, the probability of getting, say,

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,870
a king is 1 in 13.

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,210
This is because there are 13 possibilities.

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,540
You can get an ace, a 2, a 3, a 4, et cetera, 10, jack, queen or king.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,060
Now, if we deal a king for the first card and I don&#39;t replace it,

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,300
then the problem of getting a king in the second card

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,780
is less because there are only three kings left.

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,540
The probability is 3 out of not 52--

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,780
because we already dealt one card-- but out of 51.

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,690
These events are, therefore, not independent.

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,410
The first outcome affects the second.

20
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,990
To see an extreme case of non-independent events,

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,590
consider an example of drawing five beads at random

22
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,050
without replacement from an urn.

23
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,810
Three are blue, two are red.

24
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,530
I&#39;m going to generate data like this using the sample function

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,180
and assign it to x.

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,290
You can&#39;t see the outcomes.

27
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,470
Now, if I ask you to guess the color of the first bead, what do you guess?

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,510
Since there&#39;s more blue beads, there&#39;s actually a 0.6 chance of seeing blue.

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,120
That&#39;s probably what you guess.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,860
But now, I&#39;m going to show you the outcomes of the other four.

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,300
The second, third, fourth and fifth outcomes you can see here.

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,960
You can see that the three blue beads have already come out.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,600
This affects the probability of the first.

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,410
They are not independent.

35
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,660
So would you still guess blue?

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,289
Of course not.

37
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,790
Now, you know that the probability of red is 1.

38
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,900
These events are not independent.

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,760
The probabilities change once you see the other outcomes.

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,970
When events are not independent, conditional probabilities

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,290
are useful and necessary to make correct calculations.

42
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,170
We already saw an example of a conditional probability.

43
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,260
We computed the probability that a second dealt card is

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,880
a king given that the first was a king.

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,350
In probability, we use the following notation.

46
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,780
We use this dash like this as a shorthand

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,610
for given that or conditional on.

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,010
These are synonyms.

49
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,240
Note that, when two events, say A and B, are independent,

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,980
we have the following equation.

51
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,670
The probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A.

52
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,800
It doesn&#39;t matter what B is.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,500
The probability A is unchanged.

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,420
This is the mathematical way of saying it.

55
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,200
And in fact, this can be considered the mathematical definition

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,900
of independence.

57
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,730
All right now.

58
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,030
If we want to know the probability of two events, say A and B, occurring,

59
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,980
we can use the multiplication rule.

60
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,500
So the probability of A and B is equal to the probability of A multiplied

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,310
by the probability of B given that A already happened.

62
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,820
Let&#39;s use blackjack as an example.

63
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,280
In blackjack, you get assigned two random cards without replacement.

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,910
Then, you can ask for more.

65
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,980
The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

66
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,600
Face cards are worth 10 points.

67
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,760
So is the 10 card.

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,440
That&#39;s worth 10 points, too.

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,630
And aces are worth either 11 or 1.

70
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,430
So if you get an ace and a face card, you win automatically.

71
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,710
So, in blackjack, to calculate the chances of getting 21

72
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,040
in the following way, first we get an ace

73
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,900
and then we get a face card or a 10, we compute the problem of the first

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,100
being an ace and then multiply by the probability of a face card

75
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,690
or a 10 given that the first card was an ace.

76
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,240
This calculation is 1/13--

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,620
chance of getting an ace--

78
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,790
times the chance of getting a card with value 10

79
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,130
given that we already saw an ace, which is 16 out of 51.

80
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,500
We&#39;ve already taken one card out.

81
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,970
This is approximately 2%.

82
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,480
The multiplicative rule also applies to more than two events.

83
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,900
We can use induction to expand for more than two.

84
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,330
So the probability of A and B and C is equal to the probability of A times

85
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,240
the probability of B given that A happened times the probability of C

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,820
that A and b happened.

87
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,750
When we have independent events, the multiplication rule becomes simpler.

88
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,630
We simply multiply the three probabilities.

89
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,490
But we have to be very careful when we use a multiplicative rule in practice.

90
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,470
We&#39;re assuming independence, and this can

91
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,550
result in very different and incorrect probability calculations

92
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,340
when we don&#39;t actually have independence.

93
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,820
This could have dire consequences, for example, in a trial

94
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,290
if an expert doesn&#39;t really know the multiplication rule and how to use it.

95
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,110
So let&#39;s use an example.

96
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,780
This is loosely based on something that actually happened.

97
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,230
Imagine a court case in which the suspect was described

98
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,880
to have a mustache and a beard, and the prosecution brings in an expert

99
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,410
to argue that, because 1 in 10 men have beards and 1 in 5 men

100
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:53,310
has mustaches, using the multiplication rule, this means that only 2% of men

101
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,600
have both beards and mustaches--

102
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,950
1/10 times 1/5.

103
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,860
2% is a pretty unlikely event.

104
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,330
However, to multiply like this, we need to assume independence.

105
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,270
And in this case, it&#39;s clearly not true.

106
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,130
The conditional probability of a man having a mustache conditional on them

107
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,660
having a beard is quite high.

108
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,490
It&#39;s about 95%.

109
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,320
So the correct calculation actually gives us a much higher probability.

110
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,790
It&#39;s 9%.

111
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,410
So there&#39;s definitely reasonable doubt.
