##STATEMENT:

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run. Let's run the Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 times.
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# Create an object called `results` that replicates for `B` iterations a simulated series and determines whether that series contains at least four wins for the Cavs.



# Calculate the frequency out of `B` iterations that the Cavs won at least four games in the remainder of the series. Print your answer to the console.

##ANSWER

# Create an object called `results` that replicates for `B` iterations a simulated series and determines whether that series contains at least four wins for the Cavs.
results <- replicate(B, {
  simulated_games <- sample(c(0,1), 6, replace = TRUE)
  sum(simulated_games) >= 4
})

# Calculate the frequency out of `B` iterations that the Cavs won at least four games in the remainder of the series. Print your answer to the console.
mean(results)
