RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In the examples we have seen,

1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,850
we have used 10,000 Monte Carlo experiments.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,840
It turns out that this provided very accurate estimates for the examples

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,280
we looked at.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,170
In more complex calculations, 10,000 may not nearly be enough.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,250
Also for some calculations, 10,000 experiments

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,840
might not be computationally feasible, and it might be more than we need.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,540
In practice, we won&#39;t know what the answer

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,170
is, so we don&#39;t know if our Monte Carlo estimate is accurate.

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,460
We know that the larger the number of experiments, we&#39;ve

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,810
been using the letter B to represent that, the better the approximation.

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,390
But how big do we need it to be?

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,480
This is actually a challenging question, and answering it often requires

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,080
advanced theoretical statistics training.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,090
One practical approach we will describe here

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,230
is to check for the stability of the estimate.

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,650
Here&#39;s an example with the birthday problem.

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,200
We&#39;re going to use n equals 22.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
There&#39;s 22 people.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,180
So we&#39;re going to run a simulation where we compute or estimate

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,520
the probability of two people having a certain birthday using different sizes

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,380
of the Monte Carlo simulations.

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,670
So the value of b going to go from 10, to 20, to 40, to 100, et cetera.

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,990
We compute the simulation, and now we look at the values

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,810
that we get for each simulation.

25
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,030
Remember, each simulation has a different b,

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,950
a different number of experiments.

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,950
When we see this graph, we can see that it&#39;s wiggling up and down.

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,060
That&#39;s because the estimate is not stable yet.

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,590
It&#39;s not such a great estimate.

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,660
But as b gets bigger and bigger, eventually it starts to stabilize.

31
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,780
And that&#39;s when we start getting a feeling for the fact

32
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,170
that now perhaps we have a large enough number of experiments.
