RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Suppose you&#39;re in a classroom with 50 people.

1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,770
If we assume this is a randomly selected group,

2
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,030
what is the chance that at least two people have the same birthday?

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,380
Although it is somewhat advanced, we can actually deduce this mathematically,

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,940
and we do this later, but now, we&#39;re going to use Monte Carlo simulations.

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,450
For simplicity, we assumed that nobody was born on February 29th.

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,670
This actually doesn&#39;t change the answer much.

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,660
All right, first, note that birthdays can be represented

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,810
as numbers between 1 and 365.

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,070
So a sample of 50 random birthdays can be obtained simply

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,550
using the sample function, like this.

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,870
To check if, in this particular set of 50 people we have at least two

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,860
with the same birthday, we can use the function duplicated,

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,400
which returns true whenever an element of a vector

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,440
has already appeared in that vector.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,430
So here&#39;s an example.

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,989
If I type duplicated 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, ,

17
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,330
we get true&#39;s for the 1 and the 3 the second time they appear.

18
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,350
So to check if two birthdays were the same,

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,970
we simply use any and duplicated functions, like this.

20
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,020
And in the case that we just generated, we actually do have this happening.

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,620
We did have two people, at least two people, with the same birthday.

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,510
We get true.

23
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,380
Now, to estimate the probability, we&#39;re going to repeat this experiment.

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,290
We&#39;re going to run a Monte Carlo simulation over and over again.

25
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,920
So what we do is we do it 10,000 times.

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,440
We use the replicate function like this.

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,800
And when we&#39;re done, we get that the probability

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,370
of having two people, at least two people, with the same birthday

29
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,820
in a group of 50 people is about 98%.

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,450
Were you expecting this to be so high?

31
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,922
People tend to underestimate these probabilities,

32
00:01:57,922 --> 00:02:00,130
so it might be an opportunity for you to bet and make

33
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,450
some money off of your friends.

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,540
To get an intuition as to why this is so high,

35
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,780
think of what happens as you get close to 365 people.

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,250
At this stage, we run out of days, and the probability is 1.

37
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,530
In the next video, we&#39;re going to actually compute

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,930
this probability for different group sizes

39
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,910
and see how fast it gets close to 1.
