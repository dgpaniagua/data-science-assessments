##EXERCISE:

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2 / 38

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1 - p_green

# Calculate the expected outcome of `Y`, the mean outcome per bet in 10,000 bets

##ANSWER

17*p_green + -1*p_not_green
