##EXERCISE:

# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Calculate the expected outcome if you win $17 if the ball lands on green and you lose $1 if the ball doesn't land on green


##ANSWER

abs(-1-17) * sqrt(p_green*p_not_green)
