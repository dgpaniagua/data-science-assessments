##EXERCISE:

# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Calculate the expected loss due to default out of 10,000 loans


##ANSWER

n * p_default * loss_per_foreclosure
