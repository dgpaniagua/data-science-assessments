##STATEMENT:

cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

# The variable 'p_1' is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)

# Assign a variable 'p_2' as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw with replacement.

# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan using `p_1` and `p_2`.

##ANSWER:

# Assign a variable 'p_2' as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw without replacement.
p_2 <- (magenta + yellow) / ((cyan - 1) + magenta + yellow)

# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan using `p_1` and `p_2`.
p_1 * p_2
