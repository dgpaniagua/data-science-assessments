## STATEMENT:

# Assign the variable 'p_no6' as the probability of not seeing a 6 on a single roll.


# Calculate the probability of not seeing a 6 on six rolls using `p_no6`. Print your result to the console: do not assign it to a variable.

## ANSWER:

# Assign the variable 'p_no6' as the probability of not seeing a 6 on a single roll.
p_no6 <- 5/6

# Calculate the probability of not seeing a 6 on six rolls using `p_no6`. Print your result to the console: do not assign it to a variable.
p_no6^6
