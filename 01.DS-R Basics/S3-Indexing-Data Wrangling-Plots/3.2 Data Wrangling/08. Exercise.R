##STATEMENT:

# Load library
library(dplyr)

## Define the rate column
murders <- mutate(murders, rate =  total / population * 100000, rank = rank(-rate))

# show the result and only include the state, rate, and rank columns, all in one line, in that order


##ANSWER
filter(murders, (region=="Northeast" | region=="West") & (rate < 1)) %>% select(state, rate, rank)
