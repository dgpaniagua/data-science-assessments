##STATEMENT:

# Store the murder rate per 100,000 for each state, in murder_rate
murder_rate <- murders$total/murders$population*100000


# Compute the average murder rate using `mean` and store it in object named `avg`


# How many states have murder rates below avg ? Check using sum 


##ANSWER

# Compute the average murder rate using `mean` and store it in object named `avg`
avg <- mean(murder_rate)

# How many states have murder rates below avg ? Check using sum 
sum(murder_rate<avg)
