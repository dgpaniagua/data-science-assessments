##STATEMENT:

# Define a variable states to be the state names from the murders data frame


# Define a variable ranks to determine the population size ranks 


# Define a variable ind to store the indexes needed to order the population values


# Create a data frame my_df with the state name and its rank and ordered from least populous to most 


##ANSWER

# Define a variable states to be the state names from the murders data frame
states <- murders$state

# Define a variable ranks to determine the population size ranks 
ranks <- rank(murders$population)

# Define a variable ind to store the indexes needed to order the population values
ind <- order(murders$population)

# Create a data frame my_df with the state name and its rank and ordered from least populous to most 
my_df <- data.frame(states[ind], ranks[ind])
