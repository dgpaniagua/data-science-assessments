##STATEMENT:

# Create a vector m of integers that starts at 32 and ends at 99.
m <- 32:99

# Determine the length of object m.
length(m)

# Create a vector x of integers that starts at 12 and ends at 73.

# Determine the length of object x.

##ANSWER

# Create a vector x of integers that starts at 12 and ends at 73.
x <- 12:73

# Determine the length of object x.
length(x)
